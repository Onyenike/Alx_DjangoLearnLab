# Import the Book model from bookshelf.models import Book # Retrieve the book instance with the title '1984'. # IMPORTANT: If you have multiple books titled '1984', you might need to retrieve # by a more specific identifier like its primary key (ID) if known: # book = Book.objects.get(id=YOUR_BOOK_ID) try: book = Book.objects.get(title='1984') except Book.DoesNotExist: print("Book with title '1984' not found. It might already be 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'.") # If the book might already be updated, you could try fetching it by the new title book = Book.objects.get(title='Nineteen Eighty-Four') print("Found book with title 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. Proceeding to verify/re-update.") # Update the title attribute book.title = 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' # Save the changes to the database book.save() # Verify the updated title (you would typically print this in the shell) print(book.title) # Expected output: Nineteen Eighty-Four
